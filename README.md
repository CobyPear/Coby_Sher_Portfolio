# Responsive Portfolio 

Portfolio can be found here: https://cobypear.github.io/Responsive_Portfolio/

  Starting a bit early on the homework. After watching a few tutorials, I think it will be easier to start from scratch, so I'm going to be (maybe) scrapping this version, I will however leave it up for self reference.

  Fixed issues with navbar (for some reason the script tags I copy/pasted from the bootstrap website weren't working).
